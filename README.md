<h1>phpTube</h1>
<p>a shitty youtube clone written entirely in php</p>
<h2>why??????</h2>
<p>I made this mostly as a challenge for myself, <code>"a video sharing website but no SQL or anything like that."</code></p>
<br>
<h1>prerequisites</h1>
<p>
  in order for phpTube to work, you need to install <code>ffmpeg</code>, <code>php</code> and <code>some sort of webserver that can execute php</code>
<h1>installation</h1>
<p>
  1. git clone the repo.<br>
  2. insert phpTube in an empty root directory. (phpTube <b>CAN'T</b> run in a subdirectory, so setup a subdomain or something.)<br>
  3. wowies, it works.<br>
  4. $$$ profit $$$
